*IDEA135: Games at Work*
# Final Project: Critical Play

"If photographs are images, and films are moving images, then video
games are actions." - Alexander Galloway

Work collaboratively (in groups of two or three), to create a fun,
fully-functioning, playable user-interactive experience that
critiques, subverts, or deviates from familiar or traditional video
game genres, norms, subjects, or player goals.

You may use any of the digital game engines we have used in this
course (i.e. Twine, p5.play, Unity) in order to create your game.

## Choose one of the Following:

1. Revise/improve/build upon a group member's sketch or project from
earlier in the semester. You may add new scenes, assets, and change
game structures/goals. You may add/combine elements from multiple
projects and sketches.

2. Create an entirely new project, for which you choose technical or
creative goals that in some way exceed or realize the unmet technical
and creative goals of your first two projects.

## Rules

- You must create your game in a group of 2 or 3 students. While there
  are no strict rules about the work each member of the group must do
  (e.g. game design, coding, sprite creation), it is expected that
  each member of the group will make a significant creative
  contribution to the game. Keep a detailed log indicating which
  members of the group have done what specific work related to the
  game.

- You may bring in specific talents you have been cultivating in other
  classes or independent work (e.g. 3D animation, writing, web design,
  foreign language, sculpture, martial arts, experimental methods from
  the social sciences). But it is strongly advised that you not try to
  learn a completely new talent in order to create this project. In
  other words, if you've never done any 3D modelling before, don't
  propose to make a 3D game.

- Your game must have levels, including a start and end screen (if
  there is an end).

- Your game must be fun to play, even if it is an "anti-game."

## Learning Objectives

1. Build upon and revise previous work.
2. Develop a more sophisticated understanding of tools and creative
techniques introduced earlier in the semester.
3. Use frameworks and techniques for creative collaboration.
4. Blow minds.
